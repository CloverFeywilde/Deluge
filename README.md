Deluge - A web Based Visual Novel

This project originally was something I made by myself for a 2 week summer gamejam using zero libraries, templates, or engines. Obviously it's very rough around the edges, but I'm considering cleaning this up a bit and adding a few things. Eventually I'd like to rewrite and remake this project. 

To play: Just download it and double click on index.html. It should open in your browser of choice and you can begin playing. Alternatively, you can go to forleafe.itch.io and play it there.

There are currently 5 endings plus a secret ending. Can you escape from the abyss?
